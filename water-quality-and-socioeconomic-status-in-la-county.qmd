# Does Socioeconomic Status Have an Affect on Drinking Water Quality in Family Households in LA County?

## Introduction and Significance

## Methods

```{r message = FALSE}
# loading in needed libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(stats)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
library(sf)
```

```{r message=FALSE}

# reading in the data 

income_la <- read_csv('./data/Median_Income_and_AMI_(census_tract).csv') %>% 
  rename('census_tract' = 'tract')

# reading in water la data

los_angeles <- read_csv('data/cal_enviro_4.csv') %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(california_county == 'Los Angeles')


# joining in the two datasets

income_water_la <- left_join(los_angeles, income_la, by = "census_tract") %>% 
  na.omit()


# preliminary plotting
lm(drinking_water ~ med_hh_income, data = income_water_la)

summary(income_water_la$med_hh_income)

# need units for drinking_water 
      # sum of percentiles for drinking water index (includes lead, arsenic, TCM, Perchlorate)


####**** Ideas : either stick with drinking water column (units unclear) or cardiovascular disease #######


ggplot(income_water_la, aes(x = med_hh_income, y = cardiovascular_disease))+
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm', col = 'red')+
  labs(x = 'Median Household Income (USD)',
       y = 'Cardiovascular Disease-related ED visits per 10,000 people',
       title = '     Median Income vs. Cardiovascular Disease')+
  theme_classic()
